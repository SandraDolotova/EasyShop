/*EasyShopper Mart
Build an application for a supermarket.
The application should be able to collect information about products in the supermarket (name, the total number of the product available, price, weight and etc).
Should have a main menu which is controlled by a loop where users can choose what they want to do e.g add new user, add product, buy product, etc.
We should be able to buy multiple products from the supermarket and every time a product is bought, the number of the available products should go down.
Also should be a report on how much has been sold and the history of sales.
For products, we would like to track the cost of the goods supplied to the shop and how much is the selling price.
This way, we can also provide a report of sales to the shop owner (like a profit and loss statement)
When the product is finished, the system should show an error if you try to buy the product error should be “item is sold out”.
It should be possible to tell what you want to buy from the supermarket by giving the name of the product with scanner (keyboard) and how many you want to buy at a time, also with scanner.
All information about the application should be collected through the scanner if you make an application in CLI / terminal
or if you want an hybrid solution, you can use something called JOption which has input with your CLI or if you have the knowledge, you can make a UI application.
For user, it should be possible to provide name, email, password and balance for user in the supermarket
(multiple user can be registered) and when a user will buy product, user balance should be reduced.
If the user doesn’t have money left also error should be shown to the user “not enough money to buy product”
Should be possible to register new user or switch users
Only certain type of users can add product to the supermarket, made different types for users such as (buyer, sales representative, owner etc),
at start of program, ask user to login using their info then direct them to the correct menu for their user type.
Should be possible collect all information about the product user etc at the start of program and then ask the user to enter the name of product they want to buy,
after that quantity and then do all logic what is mentioned in the task.
Save all information to the database or file depending on what you have better understanding of.*/
